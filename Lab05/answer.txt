1. Compare the top-level containers in Swing and AWT:
-AWT: 
+Frame: The main top-level container for AWT applications.
+Dialog: A top-level container used for pop-up dialogs, can be modal or modeless.
+Applet: Used for creating web applets, embedded within a web page.

-Swing:
+JFrame: A replacement for AWT's Frame, providing additional features and a consistent look-and-feel across platforms.
+JDialog: Similar to AWT's Dialog but with more functionality and better integration with the Swing component architecture.
+JApplet: Replaces AWT's Applet, providing a richer feature set.
+JWindow: Similar to JFrame but without the decorations like title bar and borders.

2. Compare the class name of components in AWT and the corresponding classâ€™s name in Swing 
=> The most significant different between two library is in Swing, all components have a
prefix "J" like "JPanel"

3. Compare the event-handling of Swing and AWT applications 

The event-handling are the same but Swing have been added more features than AWT
